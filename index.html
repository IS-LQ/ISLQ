  <main>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Intusens LiquiQ Pvt Ltd is a deep-tech startup focused on making water quality monitoring accessible and straightforward. We design advanced microbial sensors integrated with AI technology to quickly and accurately detect waterborne contaminants — all without the need for specialized labs or training. Our goal is to empower communities and organizations to take control of their water safety, ensuring clean water is available anytime, anywhere.</p>
    <p>While water monitoring is our starting point, we are also laying the groundwork to extend our sensor technology into the medical diagnostics field, aiming to improve healthcare accessibility and outcomes globally.</p>

    <h2>Our Focus</h2>
    <h3>Simple, smart microbial sensing</h3>
    <p>We create user-friendly, portable sensors that anyone can operate without technical expertise. These devices are affordable and reliable, enabling real-time, on-site water testing for individuals and communities alike. Our technology eliminates traditional barriers to microbial testing, making clean water monitoring practical and widely available.</p>

    <h2>What We Intend to Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop AI-driven rapid bacterial detection systems with zero energy or media needs.</li>
      <li>Deliver portable, affordable sensors for water quality monitoring.</li>
      <li>Expand our innovations into healthcare diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Global R&D in Smart Water Sensing</h2>
    <p>Innovations around the world are revolutionizing how we detect and analyze water quality in real time. These advances use a blend of AI, microfluidics, spectroscopy, and edge computing — enabling faster, cheaper, and more widely-deployable water sensors. Our work embraces these global trends, tailoring solutions specifically for India’s water safety challenges.</p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Researchers at MIT and Stanford have developed AI algorithms that classify waterborne bacteria rapidly and accurately using spectral and imaging data. These models enable real-time detection, drastically reducing the time needed for water quality assessments compared to traditional lab tests.</p>

    <h3>Microfluidics</h3>
    <p>Institutions like ETH Zurich and India’s IITs are pioneering microfluidic chips — tiny devices that manipulate minute amounts of fluids for bacterial analysis. These chips offer rapid, low-cost, and portable testing capabilities suitable for on-site deployment.</p>

    <h3>Spectroscopy (UV-Vis & Hyperspectral Sensors)</h3>
    <p>Advanced spectroscopy techniques enable non-destructive, on-site detection of contaminants by analyzing light absorption and spectral signatures. UV-Vis and hyperspectral sensors can identify bacterial and pollutant loads based on their unique spectral signatures.</p>

    <h3>Edge Computing</h3>
    <p>Edge computing processes data locally on the sensor device, reducing latency and the need for cloud connectivity. This is critical for remote or underserved areas where internet access may be unreliable, ensuring fast, autonomous water quality monitoring.</p>
